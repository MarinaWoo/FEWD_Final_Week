			<h2>The Crux</h2>
				<h4>A permanent address</h4>
				<p>This may sound entirely counterintuitive after an entire book about not having a permanent address. But the fact of the matter is, being a human being with a passport requires you at least to have a place to receive mail. This generally can’t be a P.O. box if you’re going to use it for things like banking, taxes and insurance. Use a family member’s, a good friend’s, or a willing participant in your nomad adventure.</p>
				<h4>A workout or wellness routine</h4>
				<p>A nomad is constantly changing their external environment, from the food they eat and bed they sleep in to the microbiome their body is exposed to. This takes a huge toll on your body, so you have to go out of your way to make health a priority. Create a weekly exercise or wellness routine that suits you—running, mediation, tai chi, swimming—and stick to it wherever you go. Obviously you’re going to have to pick activities that don’t require a lot of gear or facilities, but there are plenty of ways to do that. Pay attention to the food you eat, too. It’s fine to indulge in whatever’s local, but make sure you’re not subsisting on fried food and beer. If you can keep this part of your life in check, the rest of the instability will phase you less.</p>
				<h4>A weekly Skype call</h4>
				<p>This is another case of keeping one thing in your life constant. It’s hard when you haven’t spoken to someone in three months to tell them that, actually, this week you’re feeling pretty down. Keeping someone up to date on the big developments and small minutiae of your weekly life will mean that it will feel less daunting to admit when nomad life is become a bit challenging.</p> 
				<h4>Humility</h4>
				<p>Don’t ever forget as you hop around the world that you are, fundamentally, a guest. While it can be frustrating to deal with life’s small inconveniences in places where customer service doesn’t exist or where there is absolutely no sense of urgency, you have to accept that’s how things are done and you are simply privileged enough to experience a different way of life. Remember that the cultures, nations, and neighborhoods you pass through will operate long after you’re gone. Don’t wreck the nomadic way of life for others by being pushy, demanding, impolite, and ungracious in foreign places.</p>
				<h4>Organizational routine</h4>
				<p>Being a nomad means you have to be more organized than a regular person, not less. Things can go wrong quickly when you’re on the road, so make sure you have a place in plan for when that happens. Keep people involved in your whereabouts and plans and share access to some of your important documents via the Cloud. By all means be spontaneous, but put the groundwork in ahead of time both digitally and physically so you can do so. Have all your affairs and important documents, passwords, and accounts searchable, reachable and backed up and secure. Check your banking regularly to make sure you don’t end up stranded with a card that’s been locked or account over-withdrawn by mistake.</p>

			<h2>Tech</h2>

				<p>You can use Google maps offline with the “OK Maps“ trick. Enter this phrase into the Google</p>
				<p>Maps app and the portion of the map that’s currently visible on your screen will be saved directly to your device. Once saved, you can access that map even without a data connection.</p>
				<p>Invest in a universal adaptor with a USB jack embedded so you can charge your phone and something else simultaneously.</p>
				<p>Take a portable phone charger (or at least a cable) out with you so you never get stranded with no phone battery.</p>
				<p>Have a Dropbox folder & USB stick with photos/copies of your passport, travel insurance info, cards, ID, itinerary etc. Share this digital folder with someone before you leave so they have a downloaded copy too.</p> 
				<p>Only buy unlocked smartphones and don't forget to turn off mobile data if you’re not inserting a local SIM card.</p>
				<p>Travel with a cheap burner phone for local calls/emergencies (especially in a developing country).</p>
				<p>Get single item insurance for your gadgets in addition to travel insurance (and make sure your policy has international cover!).</p>
				<p>Skyscanner, Hipmunk, Kayak— Use both to find the cheapest flight and to set price up alerts if you have time before you actually book to get the best rate.
				<p>Screenshots are your friend when you don't have data. Take pics of maps, areas, directions, contact details when you’re on Wifi to use when you leave the house and are offline.</p>
				<p>If you’re desperate for Wifi in a city, look for corporate chains: McDonalds, Starbucks etc. You can usually sneak in without buying anything, and the networks rarely require a password.</p>
				<p>Looking for rental accommodations online? Search in the local language. A Google search in English for “rental house Tulum” will return results of vacation rentals which might fit the bill, but searching for “casas alquiler tulum” will return a much more budget-friendly list of results.</p>

			<h2>Common sense</h2>
				
					<p>If you’re traveling long-term, make sure your insurance policy extends for long trips. Some policies limit cover to one or two months, meaning if you’re going on a longer trip, you wont be covered for a single day if the insurance company sees your who trip exceeded the time limit. Call your company and ask for an extension (or buy a better policy).</p>
					<p>Always print your address and a map before you arrive in a new place (or have it screen-shotted on your phone/tablet so that you can access without wifi). If things go awry, you can show this to a taxi driver who doesn’t speak your language. A localized map is important because some cities/countries don’t go by street address and more by landmark/local knowledge.</p>
					<p>Take a picture of your luggage on your phone. If it gets lost, show this to airport officials.</p>
					<p>Traveling with physical books is a waste. Invest in a tablet/e-reader and carry maximum one book you can ditch//donate/trade when you’re finished.</p>
					<p>Don’t use the same password for everything, especially if you are always on public wifi. Better yet, use a password encryption service.</p>
					<p>Pay a little more to stay central (which doesn’t necessarily have to be touristy). If it’s a short trip, you’ll end spending more on public trans and wasting your time if you stay peripherally.</p>
					<p>If you’re totally new to a location, write down the name and address of where you’re staying (or bring a business card of the hotel) so you can hand to a taxi driver if you get lost. Even if you think you’ll remember, things always look different at night or coming home in reverse.</p> 
					<p>Know the entry requirements for wherever you’re traveling to – watch out for any ‘gotchas’. For example for U.S. citizens traveling to Costa Rica there aren’t any special considerations, however, if you happen to be coming from Perú proof of yellow fever vaccination is required. For U.S. citizens see http://travel.state.gov</p>
					<p>Have an idea of what airport transportation should cost to your destination before you land by checking on a travel forum or airport website. This way you can avoid getting ripped off. And never get in a taxi with someone who asked you “Do you need a taxi?” These people are trying to take you for a ride, literally and figuratively</p>
					<p>Oftentimes low-tech trumps high-tech. Taxi drivers can be the best resource around if, for instance, you need a yellow fever card in order to board a plane they can fix you up with one in a hurry – backdated and everything.</p>
					<p>Speaking of Yellow Fever, many developing countries, especially West African ones, require this certificate as proof that you’ve been immunized before you enter the country. Any travel doctor can provide this (both the vaccine and the certificate) and it also has a handy space for listing all your other vaccines to show you’re up to date.</p> 
					<p>Make a TripAdvisor account, use it from time to time. If you get substandard service at a hotel, tell them you plan on writing a review about your experience. They will quickly rectify the situation.</p>
					<p>If you’re using a service like Airbnb, ask your host if they’d be willing to book off the platform once you’ve arrived and established a sense of trust. Airbnb charges a booking fee, so by booking direct with your host, you avoid up to 15% of the charge, while your host receives the same amount of money. However, only do this after you’ve booked via the app and made an agreement in person. Never book with an Airbnb host who asks you to pay them directly before you’ve met them.</p>
					<p>When you leave your accommodation, don’t leave your valuables in sight. Safe’s may not always be the best bet either—as they’re the most obvious place for an untrustworthy staff member to look.</p>

			<section id="banking">
			<div id="textBlock">
			<h2>Banking</h2>
				
					<p>Notify your bank and credit card company before you travel.</p>
					<p>Never use currency exchange, especially not at airport. Know your bank’s policy on currency exchange rates. In almost every case you will get a far better exchange rate at the ATM than you will at the currency exchange booth.</p>
					<p>Get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees.</p>
					<p>Beware of developing countries where a currency like USD is more acceptable than the local currency (i.e. Mexico, Cambodia, Zimbabwe). You’ll get a better rate on just about everything if you show up with the stronger currency.</p> 
					<p>Carry around small change and bills. Relying on your card in developing countries is inconvenient and opens you up to risk of fraud and unwanted charges.</p>
					<p>Beware of cards with no chip and pin. Many places around the world are phasing out magnetic strip cards and no longer have the machines to process them. If you’re an American traveller, see if your bank has a chip and pin option as it’s more globally useful.</p>
					<p>Split up cash and cards. There’s no reason to leave the house with all your means to access to money, always leave at least one card at home.</p>  
					<p>Leverage credit card sign ups at opportune times for bonus miles.</p>
					<p>If you travel a lot,  start a second checking account so you can have a second debit card in case anything gets stolen. Keep that in a safe space so if you have to cancel a card you can still go about your life and not have to wait for a replacement.</p> 
					<p>In developing economies, black market exchange is rarely better than the ATM, but in some countries the black market is a far better deal. Argentina and Venezuela come immediately to mind. Difficulty: you need to show up with a sufficient supply of U.S. Dollars (British Pounds or Euros might work as well).</p>

			<h2>Safety</h2>
		
				<p>Wear a watch so you don’t need to take out your phone to time-check.</p> 
				<p>Travel in a jacket with an inside zipper pocket for passport, phone etc.</p>
				<p>Don’t carry a flashy, overstuffed wallet or nice handbag. A small coin purse with cash and only the cards you need is less enticing.</p>
				<p>Don’t walk around in unfamiliar neighborhoods by yourself with earphones in!</p>
				<p>It’s worth giving someone you really trust a few of your key passwords (Airbnb account, Dropbox etc). If for some reason you cant access these or your whereabouts are unknown, having these can be helpful.</p>
				<p>Have some sort of system that keeps you accountable for your whereabouts. Maybe you iMessage or email a family member every day, or have an agreement that someone makes sure you’re posting regularly on social media and checks in with you if you’re not.</p>

			<div id="textBlock">
			<h2>In Transit</h2>
		
				<p>Always check in for your flight online as soon as it’s open (usually 24 hours before departure time) for best seat selection.</p>
				<p>Charm the check-in desk agents! Comment on their hairdo, ask them about their accent, how their day is going, where they’re from. Once you’ve done that, casually inquire if the flight has any available upgrades or better seats. These people have a small amount of power, all you need to do is be charming and polite to give them a reason to wield it kindly in your favor.</p> 
				<p>If you had no luck at the check-in desk, always ask flight attendant is flight is full when you board (this way you can know whether or not you might be able to move, and she/he might clock you as someone to upgrade or move if the opportunity arises).</p>
				<p>Avoid booking flights that depart Friday through Monday as they’re always more expensive.</p>
				<p>If you’re not time strapped and up for an adventure, overnight trains/buses get you to your next destination AND save you a night's accommodation.</p>
				<p>If you have an very early flight, consider sleeping in the airport. Most terminals will have one part that doesn’t close 24 hours and this way you’ll save on taxi and accommodation. Big, international hubs may even have napping areas, but call ahead to make sure you can be indoors.</p> 
				<p>Napping on your old time zone doesn’t cure jet lag—exercise and sun does!</p>
				<p>Start adjusting to your new time zone while flying. Sleep, eat, based on the new zone, not the one you're leaving. Staying up through the flight may be tough, but it means when you arrive in your destination you’ll be so exhausted you’ll fall right asleep on the new time zone.</p>
				<p>If you’re going on a short weekend trip internally while traveling in a country and don’t need to take your whole suitcase, see if the airport have luggage lockers. This can save you on checking a bag for just a short trip.</p> 
				<p>Never board a long flight or journey without a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, facewash/wipes and moisturizer. With those, you can feel like a new person no matter what happens.</p>

			<section id="packing">
			<div id="textBlock">
			<h2>Packing</h2>

					<p>Always travel with a blazer; it makes anything look professional or dressed up instantly.</p>
					<p>You always need less pairs of shoes than you think: athletic, boots, meeting/evening shoes, and one pair of sandals will do it.</p> 
					<p>The logistical difference between carrying one carry-on and two is immense. Get your carry on down to one.</p>
					<p>Put together a dedicated travel toiletry bag, with duplicates in miniature size of your toiletries. Then you can get up and go whenever without having to decide which toiletries to take. There’s no need to travel with full-sized shampoos or face washes. A travel bottle can last up to a month and these things are available everywhere (usually for free).</p> 
					<p>Ladies, consider the Mooncup instead of tampons. It’s better for the environment and means you don’t have to constantly be buying expensive tampons abroad or packing ones you bought from home.</p> 
					<p>Rolling clothes may save suitcase space, but it also leads to overpacking in terms of weight AND means you arrive with wrinkled clothes. A better strategy for quick packing and unpacking is to pack your clothes as they’d sit on the shelf (i.e. folded in piles). Lay delicate/easily wrinkled items that are usually hung flat over the folded things.</p>
					<p>Make a mental note (or take a picture) of how you’ve arranged things in your bag and do it the same way next time. Having a system will make frequent packing easy and second-nature.</p> 
					<p>Where possible, always try to do your laundry a day or two before you leave a location; it’s much easier to pack clean clothes than a mass of dirty ones.</p>
					<p>Travel with an over-the-door hook for extra hanging space when there is none or a place to hand your coat/towel.</p>
					<p>Travel with your prescriptions and chargers in your carry-on! This way if your baggage gets lost, everything else is easily replaceable.</p> 
					<p>First aid worth toting around: immodium, sleeping pills/melatonin, disinfectant/antibacterial cream, cortisone, a general antibiotic, pain killers.</p>
					<p>Take a lightweight robe, it’s worth it for shared accommodation and communal bathrooms.</p> 
					<p>Pack a sarong that can be used as a towel, wrap, curtain etc.</p> 
					<p>Always err on the side of taking less stuff; you can always wash things or buy more!</p> 
					<p>Ear plugs, always.</p>
					<p>Buy suncream before you go (it’s often fake and almost always overpriced in developing countries).</p>
					<p>Plastic & ziplock bags— you’ll always find a use for them (shoes, rubbish, toiletries, dirty laundry).</p>
					<p>The small things add up. If you’re on the cusp of exceeding your baggage weight, start by eliminating all the small stuff you’re overpacking with: extra batteries, pens, chapsticks, notebooks, books, cables etc. Really focus on the things you know you have an immediate use for (not a “just in case”) and really only bring the emergency items you absolutely can’t get elsewhere (or will be difficult to find).<p>

			<section id="winningGear">
			<div id="textBlock">
			<h2>Winning Gear</h2>

				<p>Uniqlo ultra light down vest— Light enough that it doesn't matter if you don’t end up wearing it, warm enough that you’ll be thrilled you have it to put under a jacket when the weather takes a turn.</p>
				<p>JBL bluetooth speaker— Having good sound quality wherever you go will make you feel sane.</p> 
				<p>Mojo Slim universal adapter— It’s not the size of a brick, and has a built in USB.</p> 
				<p>Noise canceling headphones— Great for flights/</p> 
				<p>Clip a carabiner on your carry-on—Great for clipping hats, smelly running shoes, sleeping bags etc when your pack is full and you’re on the go.</p>
				<p>If you’ve got the space, bring a power strip instead of multiple adapters.</p> 
				<p>Mini Swiss Army Knife gives you tweezers, scissors and a screw driver and is usually carry-on compliant.</p>
				<p>Hyper absorbent travel towel— Most places will have a proper towel, but it’s worth carrying a light one for emergencies and beach trips.</p> 
				<p>An iPad mini or small tablet will serve many purposes: reading material, games, internet portal, movie watching, and a less risky way to check email on-the-go than pulling out your work laptop. If you travel a lot it’s worth having one in addition to a laptop.</p>
				<p>Muji mesh packing cubes— Great for keeping things separate and organized in a bag, dirty laundry, cables/chargers. Light enough that they don’t add any weight.</p>
