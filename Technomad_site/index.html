			<h2>Tech</h2>

				<p>Did you know, you can use Google maps offline?</p>
				<p>Invest in a universal adaptor with a USB jack embedded so you can charge your phone and something else simultaneously.</p>
				<p>Keep a portable phone charger on you ICE.</p>
				<p>Have a Dropbox folder & USB stick with photos/copies of your passport, travel insurance info, cards, ID, itinerary etc. Share this digital folder with someone before you leave!</p> 
				<p>Only buy unlocked smartphones and don't forget to turn off mobile data if you’re not inserting a local SIM card.</p>
				<p>Get single item insurance for your gadgets in addition to travel insurance (and make sure your policy has international cover!).</p>
				<p>Use Skyscanner, Hipmunk and Kayak to find the cheapest flight and to set price up alerts if you have time before you actually book to get the best rate.
				<p>Screenshots can be your friend when you don't have data. Take pics of maps, areas, directions, contact details when you’re on Wifi to use when you leave the house and are offline.</p>
				<p>If you’re desperate for Wifi in a city, look for corporate chains: McDonalds, Starbucks etc. You can usually sneak in without buying anything, and the networks rarely require a password.</p>
				<p>Looking for rental accommodations online? And search in the local language - a Google search in English for “rental house Tulum” will return results of vacation rentals which might fit the bill, but searching for “casas alquiler tulum” will return a much more budget-friendly list of results.</p>

			<h2>Common sense</h2>
				
					<p>If you’re traveling long-term, make sure your insurance policy extends for long trips.</p>
					<p>Always print your address and a map before you arrive in a new place (or have it screen-shotted on your phone/tablet so that you can access without wifi).</p>
					<p>Take a picture of your luggage on your phone. If it gets lost, show this to airport officials.</p>
					<p>Traveling with physical books is a waste. Invest in a tablet/e-reader and carry maximum one book you can ditch//donate/trade when you’re finished.</p>
					<p>Don’t use the same password for everything, especially if you are always on public wifi. Better yet, use a password encryption service.</p>
					<p>Pay a little more to stay central (which doesn’t necessarily have to be touristy). If it’s a short trip, you’ll end spending more on transport.</p>
					<p>Know the entry requirements for wherever you’re traveling to – watch out for any ‘gotchas’. For U.S. citizens see http://travel.state.gov</p>
					<p>Have an idea of what airport transportation should cost to your destination before you land by checking on a travel forum or airport website. This way you can avoid getting ripped off. And never get in a taxi with someone who asked you “Do you need a taxi?” These people are trying to take you for a ride, literally and figuratively</p>
					<p>Make a TripAdvisor account, use it from time to time. If you get substandard service at a hotel, tell them you plan on writing a review about your experience. They will quickly rectify the situation.</p>
					<p>If you’re using a service like Airbnb, ask your host if they’d be willing to book off the platform once you’ve arrived and established a sense of trust. Airbnb charges a booking fee, so by booking direct with your host, you avoid up to 15% of the charge.</p>

			<section id="banking">
			<div id="textBlock">
			<h2>Banking</h2>
				
					<p>Notify your bank and credit card company before you travel.</p>
					<p>Never use currency exchange, especially not at airport. Know your bank’s policy on currency exchange rates. In almost every case you will get a far better exchange rate at the ATM than you will at the currency exchange booth.</p>
					<p>Get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees.</p>
					<p>Beware of developing countries where a currency like USD is more acceptable than the local currency (i.e. Mexico, Cambodia, Zimbabwe). You’ll get a better rate on just about everything if you show up with the stronger currency.</p> 
					<p>Carry around small change and bills. Relying on your card in developing countries is inconvenient and opens you up to risk of fraud and unwanted charges.</p>
					<p>Beware of cards with no chip and pin. Many places around the world are phasing out magnetic strip cards and no longer have the machines to process them. If you’re an American traveller, see if your bank has a chip and pin option as it’s more globally useful.</p>
					<p>Split up cash and cards. There’s no reason to leave the house with all your means to access to money, always leave at least one card at home.</p>  
					<p>Leverage credit card sign ups at opportune times for bonus miles.</p>
					<p>If you travel a lot,  start a second checking account so you can have a second debit card in case anything gets stolen. Keep that in a safe space so if you have to cancel a card you can still go about your life and not have to wait for a replacement.</p> 
					<p>In developing economies, black market exchange is rarely better than the ATM, but in some countries the black market is a far better deal. Argentina and Venezuela come immediately to mind. Difficulty: you need to show up with a sufficient supply of U.S. Dollars (British Pounds or Euros might work as well).</p>

			<h2>Safety</h2>
		
				<p>Wear a watch so you don’t need to take out your phone to time-check.</p> 
				<p>Travel in a jacket with an inside zipper pocket for passport, phone etc.</p>
				<p>Don’t carry a flashy, overstuffed wallet or nice handbag. A small coin purse with cash and only the cards you need is less enticing.</p>
				<p>Don’t walk around in unfamiliar neighborhoods by yourself with earphones in!</p>
				<p>It’s worth giving someone you really trust a few of your key passwords (Airbnb account, Dropbox etc). If for some reason you cant access these or your whereabouts are unknown, having these can be helpful.</p>
				<p>Have some sort of system that keeps you accountable for your whereabouts. Maybe you iMessage or email a family member every day, or have an agreement that someone makes sure you’re posting regularly on social media and checks in with you if you’re not.</p>

			<h2>Transit</h2>
		
				<p>Always check in for your flight online as soon as it’s open (usually 24 hours before departure time) for best seat selection.</p>
				<p>Charm the check-in desk agents! Comment on their hairdo, ask them about their accent, how their day is going, where they’re from. Once you’ve done that, casually inquire if the flight has any available upgrades or better seats. These people have a small amount of power, all you need to do is be charming and polite to give them a reason to wield it kindly in your favor.</p> 
				<p>If you had no luck at the check-in desk, always ask flight attendant is flight is full when you board (this way you can know whether or not you might be able to move, and she/he might clock you as someone to upgrade or move if the opportunity arises).</p>
				<p>Avoid booking flights that depart Friday through Monday as they’re always more expensive.</p>
				<p>If you’re not time strapped and up for an adventure, overnight trains/buses get you to your next destination AND save you a night's accommodation.</p>
				<p>If you have an very early flight, consider sleeping in the airport. Most terminals will have one part that doesn’t close 24 hours and this way you’ll save on taxi and accommodation. Big, international hubs may even have napping areas, but call ahead to make sure you can be indoors.</p> 
				<p>Napping on your old time zone doesn’t cure jet lag—exercise and sun does!</p>
				<p>Start adjusting to your new time zone while flying. Sleep, eat, based on the new zone, not the one you're leaving. Staying up through the flight may be tough, but it's worth it!</p>
				<p>If you’re going on a short weekend trip internally while traveling in a country and don’t need to take your whole suitcase, see if the airport have luggage lockers. This can save you on checking a bag for just a short trip.</p> 
				<p>Remember, with a toothbrush and wet-wipes you can feel like a new person no matter what happens.</p>

			<h2>Packing</h2>

					<p>Always travel with a blazer; it makes anything look professional or dressed up instantly.</p>
					<p>You always need fewer shoes than you think: athletic, boots, meeting/evening shoes, and one pair of sandals will do it.</p> 
					<p>The logistical difference between carrying one carry-on and two is immense!</p>
					<p>Put together a dedicated travel toiletry bag, with mini duplicates of your toiletries.</p> 
					<p>Ladies, consider the Mooncup instead of tampons...</p> 
					<p>Rolling clothes may save suitcase space, but it also leads to overpacking!</p>
					<p>Make a mental note (or take a picture) of how you’ve arranged things in your bag and do it the same way next time. Having a system will make frequent packing easy and second-nature.</p> 
					<p>Where possible, always try to do your laundry a day or two before you leave.</p>
					<p>Travel with an over-the-door hook for extra hanging space!</p>
					<p>First aid worth toting around: immodium, sleeping pills/melatonin, disinfectant/antibacterial cream, cortisone, a general antibiotic, pain killers.</p>
					<p>Take a lightweight robe, it’s worth it for shared accommodation!</p> 
					<p>Buy suncream before you go (it’s often fake / overpriced in developing countries).</p>
					<p>Plastic & ziplock bags— you’ll always find a use for them (shoes, rubbish, toiletries, dirty laundry).</p>
					<p>The small things add up. If you’re on the cusp of exceeding your baggage weight, start by eliminating all the small stuff.<p>

			<h2>Winning Gear</h2>

				<p>Uniqlo ultra light down vest— Light enough that it doesn't matter if you don’t end up wearing it, warm enough that you’ll be thrilled you have it to put under a jacket when the weather takes a turn.</p>
				<p>JBL bluetooth speaker— Having good sound quality wherever you go will make you feel sane.</p> 
				<p>Mojo Slim universal adapter— It’s not the size of a brick, and has a built in USB.</p> 
				<p>Noise canceling headphones— Great for flights/</p> 
				<p>Clip a carabiner on your carry-on—Great for clipping hats, smelly running shoes, sleeping bags etc when your pack is full and you’re on the go.</p>
				<p>If you’ve got the space, bring a power strip instead of multiple adapters.</p> 
				<p>Mini Swiss Army Knife gives you tweezers, scissors and a screw driver and is usually carry-on compliant.</p>
				<p>Hyper absorbent travel towel— Most places will have a proper towel, but it’s worth carrying a light one for emergencies and beach trips.</p> 
				<p>An iPad mini or small tablet will serve many purposes: reading material, games, internet portal, movie watching, and a less risky way to check email on-the-go than pulling out your work laptop. If you travel a lot it’s worth having one in addition to a laptop.</p>
				<p>Muji mesh packing cubes— Great for keeping things separate and organized in a bag, dirty laundry, cables/chargers. Light enough that they don’t add any weight.</p>

				<p>Rosie and I met in Cape Town last year and as kindred nomadic and tech spirits, often chat about how awesome it is to work on the fly. In fact she was the acatlyst for my moe to London to work remotely for WooThemes. We put these tips together, together. The way we like to do a lot of stuff.</p>

			<h2>The Crux</h2>
				<p>You'll need a permanent address.This may sound entirely counterintuitive after an entire book about not having a permanent address. But the fact of the matter is, being a human being with a passport requires you at least to have a place to receive mail. This generally can’t be a P.O. box if you’re going to use it for things like banking, taxes and insurance. Use a family member’s, a good friend’s, or a willing participant in your nomad adventure.</p>
				<h4>A workout or wellness routine</h4>
				<p>A nomad is constantly changing their external environment, from the food they eat and bed they sleep in to the microbiome their body is exposed to. This takes a huge toll on your body, so you have to go out of your way to make health a priority. Create a weekly exercise or wellness routine that suits you—running, mediation, tai chi, swimming—and stick to it wherever you go. Pay attention to the food you eat, too. It’s fine to indulge in whatever’s local, but make sure you’re not subsisting on fried food and beer. If you can keep this part of your life in check, the rest of the instability will phase you less.</p>
				<h4>A weekly Skype call</h4>
				<p>This is another case of keeping one thing in your life constant. It’s hard when you haven’t spoken to someone in three months to tell them that, actually, this week you’re feeling shitty. Keeping someone up to date on the big developments and small minutiae of your weekly life makes it less daunting to admit when nomad life gets tough.</p> 
				<h4>Humility</h4>
				<p>Don’t ever forget as you hop around the world that you are, fundamentally, a guest. Remember that the cultures, nations, and neighborhoods you pass through will operate long after you’re gone. Don’t wreck the nomadic way of life for others by being pushy, demanding, impolite, and ungracious in foreign places.</p>
				<h4>Get organized</h4>
				<p>Being a nomad means you have to be more organized than a regular person, not less. Keep people involved in your whereabouts and plans and share access to some of your important documents via the Cloud. By all means be spontaneous, but put the groundwork in ahead of time both digitally and physically so you can do so.</p>
